\begin{abstract}
	In the past decades, several fault injection techniques have been studied, such as Laser Fault Injection (EMFI), Electromagnetic Fault Injection (LFI), or Body Biasing Injection.
	Each method employs the manipulation of different physical quantities to achieve their goal.
	EMFI takes advantage of the electromagnetic susceptibility of integrated circuits, LFI uses the photo-sensitivity of the silicon, and BBI the conductive nature of the silicon substrate composing the ICs.
	Among these methods, BBI, although it has gained interest in the past few years, have still a lot of things to disclose.
	Particularly, methods to set up repeatable BBI platforms and experiment still need to be explored.
	In this context, this work aims at presenting our work on BBI in the past few years in its entirety, such as the set up of better platforms, a differential fault attack using BBI, and a simulation flow dedicated to BBI.

\section{Body biasing injection platforms modeling}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} objective of this first section is to present the work done concerning electrical modeling of integrated circuits in a BBI context.
Developing IC models in that specific case is not an easy task.
Indeed, modern digital ICs contains billions of transistors, and even considering microcontrollers where the transistor count is less important, with current technologies, it is impossible to evaluate circuits at a transistor level.

Therefore, and as it has been proposed in \textcolor{cyan}{FDTC2022 and FDTC2023}, we approach the problem using transistor-less models.
These are developed thanks to the internal structure of integrated circuits, including:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The power supply network;
	\item The standard-cells;
	\item The silicon substrate.
\end{itemize}
These three elements, and their internal structure, allow to elaborate average models able to represent their macro behavior.
Fig. \ref{fig_alim_std} illustrates the base symbolic diagram used for our design.
It represents a standard-cell segment, composed of logic gates and decoupling elements, with a fixed height of 5 Âµm and a variable width.

%\IEEEPARstart{W}{hen} studying integrated circuits in a fault injection context, it is often required to elaborate electrical models.
%They allow simulating parts or entire circuits subjected to BBI, therefore acquiring insights on the mechanisms at work.
%The acquired knowledge allows to set up more reliable experiments as well as countermeasures.
%
%In this context, we developed, thanks to previous works on the subject \textcolor{cyan}{Citations ICI}, electrical models

%\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} section approaches the electrical modeling of BBI platforms and integrated circuits.
%As it has been proposed in \textcolor{cyan}{Cosade2022Chancel, FDTC2022\&2023Chancel}, it is possible to model BBI ICs using transistor-less models.
%It has the advantage of providing a somewhat precise evaluation of the mechanisms at work, while allowing for large simulations in reasonable times.
%Within this context, we decided

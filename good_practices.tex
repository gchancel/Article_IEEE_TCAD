\section{How to perform BBI in a better way}
	In the first place, we will analyze, from a theoretical perspective, a typical BBI platform.
	To do so, we created simple platform models allowing to highlight the major limiting factors of such platforms.
	\input{./figures/bbi-typical.tex}
	The typical platform model is described in Fig. \ref{bbi_setups}.a and shows the main components making a BBI platform such as:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The voltage pulse generator;
		\item The transmission line;
		\item The grounding installation;
		\item The IC target.
	\end{itemize}
	In addition to this, the schematic shows some important flaws we are going to address.
	While this is not always the case, pulse generator are typically specified to be loaded with a 50 \textomega load.
	Three main flaws lie in the platform in its current state:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The pulse generator
	\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{S}{everal} researches have studied Body Biasing Injection (BBI) in the past few years.
While this injection method had been \textcolor{orange}{paused/forgotten} for a few years, it has recently regained some interest.
Among the latest studies, a modeling and simulation flow has been proposed, alongside better platforms allowing to achieve greater reproducibility and a deeper analysis of the mechanisms at works in digital integrated circuits subjected to BBI.
In addition to that

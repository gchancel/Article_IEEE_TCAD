It consists in applying a voltage pulse onto the backside surface of an integrated circuit with a needle.

Within this context, this paper provides insights about the interest of thinning the substrate of ICs in order to enhance the efficiency of BBI as well as its spatial resolution. Those insights were obtained both by experiment and simulation. As a result, elements for simulating the propagation of a perturbation are provided.",

    abstract={Electromagnetic (EM) waves have been recently pointed out as a medium for fault injection within integrated circuits (IC). Indeed, it has been experimentally demonstrated that an EM pulse (EMP), produced with a high-voltage pulse generator and an injector similar to that used to perform EM analyses, was susceptible to create faults exploitable from a cryptanalysis viewpoint. An analysis of the induced faults revealed that they originated from timing constraint violations. In this context, this paper demonstrates that EM injection, performed with enhanced injectors, can produce not only timing faults but also bit-set and bit-reset faults on an IC at rest. This first result clearly extends the range of the threats associated with EM fault injection. It then demonstrates, considering two different ICs under operation: an FPGA and a modern microcontroller, that faults produced by EMP injection are not timing faults but correspond to a different model which is presented in this paper. This model allows to explain experimental results introduced in all former communications.},

For an AES-128, this second attack provides the key by using less than 250 faulty ciphertexts.",

    abstract = {In state-of-the-art design paradigm, time, space and power efficiency are considered the primary design constraints. Quite often, this approach adversely impacts the security of the overall system, especially when security is adopted as a countermeasure after some vulnerability is identified. In this position paper, we motivate the idea that security should also be considered as an architectural design constraint in addition to time, space and power. We show that security and efficiency objectives along the three design axes of time, space and power are in fact tightly coupled while identifying that security stands in direct contrast with them across all layers of architectural design. We attempt to prove our case utilizing a proof-by-evidence approach wherein we refer to various works across literature that explicitly imply the eternal conflict between security and efficiency. Thus, security has to be treated as a design constraint from the very beginning. Additionally, we advocate a security-aware design flow starting from the choice of cryptographic primitives, protocols and system design.}

Among them, Side-Channel Analysis (SCA) is a common practice to stress the security of embedded devices like smartcards or secure controllers. Nowadays, it has become more than relevant on mobile and connected devices requiring a high security level. Yet, their applicability to smartphones is not obvious, as the architecture of modern System-on-Chips (SoC) is becoming ever more complex.This paper describes how a secret AES key was retrieved from the hardware cryptoprocessor of a smartphone. It is part of an attack scenario targeting the bootloader decryption. The focus is on practical realization and the challenges it brings. In particular, catching meaningful signals emitted by the cryptoprocessor embedded in the main System-on-Chip can be troublesome. Indeed, the Package-on-Package technology makes access to the die problematic and prevents straightforward near-field electromagnetic measurements. The described scenario can apply to any device whose chain-of-trust relies on firmware encryption, such as many smartphones or Internet-of-Things nodes.},

We explain that the fault sensitivity exhibits sensitive-data dependency and can be used to retrieve the secret key.

    abstract = {As security constraints are becoming more and more important, even for low-cost and low-power devices, new attacks and countermeasures are constantly proposed. Following this trend, Body Bias Injection (BBI) was introduced a few years ago. This new fault injection method consists in applying a high voltage pulse on the circuit substrate to induce faults. This paper presents an advanced evaluation bench allowing to perform BBI attacks with a good repeatability to evaluate the sensitivity of various circuits to this new threat. The moderate cost of this setup offers the opportunity for every electronic laboratory to use this new attack method and evaluate its effect on various devices. In addition, the physical effects of such attacks are described and a more accurate attack model is given.},

    abstract="In this paper we describe a differential fault attack technique working against Substitution-Permutation Networks, and requiring very few faulty ciphertexts. The fault model used is realistic, as we consider random faults affecting bytes (faults affecting one only bit are much harder to induce). We implemented our attack on a PC for both the AES and Khazad. We are able to break the AES-128 with only 2 faulty ciphertexts, assuming the fault occurs between the antepenultimate and the penultimate MixColumn; this is better than the previous fault attacks against AES [6][10][11]. Under similar hypothesis, Khazad is breakable with 3 faulty ciphertexts.",

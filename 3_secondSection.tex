\section{Body biasing injection platforms modeling}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} section approaches the electrical modeling of BBI platforms and integrated circuits.
As it has been proposed in \textcolor{red}{Cosade2022Chancel, FDTC2022\&2023Chancel}, it is possible to model BBI ICs using transistor-less models.
It has the advantage of providing a somewhat precise evaluation of the mechanisms at work, while allowing for large simulations in reasonable times.
Within this context, we decided

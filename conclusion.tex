\section{Conclusion}
	\IEEEPARstart{B}{ody} biasing injection has seen a re-emergence since 2020 \cite{bbiColin}, and various works have brought more and more knowledge throughout the years.
	BBI, contrary to EMFI or LFI, uses the silicon substrate of as the main physical medium to interact, transfer energy, and disturb integrated circuits.
	We introduced, through this work, the cumulative knowledge we gathered concerning BBI.
	This involves various aspects of the subjects.

	First, we studied better methods to improve BBI experiments repeatability and reliability through low-cost platform modifications.
	We supported these results with actual experiments such as Fault Analysis Mappings and a Differential Fault Attack.

	Then, we introduced large-scale IC modeling thanks to the use of transistor-less models allowing to reduce the computational power required to simulate BBI.

	Eventually, we extended this "transistor-less models" simulation flow to consider the logic functions of integrated circuits under BBI.
	This allowed us to understand the mechanisms at work during fault creation in integrated circuits under BBI, such as data-dependent bit set/reset faults, in addition to understanding the locality of BBI effects.
